            ## Cat 6 vs Cat 6a

            Cat 6 is probably fine... `iperf`:

            ```
            [  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  11.5 GBytes  9.90 Gbits/sec
            ```

            But you should probably use Cat 6a

            <br/>

            - This isn't fiber, copper is cheap!
            - 10GbE spec recommends Cat 6a for new installations

            ## But what about bonding?

            We tried bonding several 1GbE links... meh.

            <br/>

            - Bonding increases channel capacity, not individual flows
            - HP switches use a Layer 3 transmit hash :(
            - Sucks when your client/server ratio is low

            ## Spare parts

            Parts fail, and replacements are hard to find

            <br/>

            - Buy several spares with every order
            - ie, 2+ spare drives per server
            - ie, 1+ spare power supplies
            - Not a problem if you have a good local supplier
